This work employs PBCore. The PBCore (Public Broadcasting Metadata 
Dictionary) was created by the public broadcasting community in the 
United States of America for use by public broadcasters and others. 
Initial development funding for PBCore was provided by the Corporation 
for Public Broadcasting. The PBCore is built on the foundation of the 
Dublin Core (ISO 15836), an international standard for resource 
discovery (http://dublincore.org), and has been reviewed by the Dublin 
Core Metadata Initiative Usage Board. Copyright: 2005, Corporation for

LOCAL DEVELOPMENT SET-UP
========================

This needs the following gems:
 * chronic
 * libxml-ruby
 * rake
 * thin
 * packet
 * whenever (from http://gemcutter.org/)

These gems are optional but will magically improve performance if present:
 * mysql
 * fast_xs

Other gems are unpacked into vendor/gems/ and don't need to be
installed specially.

The sphinx libraries apparently need OpenSSL for Ruby, which is not a gem.

Also you need sphinx, from http://www.sphinxsearch.com/

If you plan to deploy, you need capistrano and capistrano-ext as well.


SERVER SET-UP
=============

On the server, install ruby (including rubygems), nginx, git,
sphinxsearch. Then install the required gems as above.

Then, copy config/deploy/site.rb.example to config/deploy/mysite.rb and
fill in the blanks. Create the 'pbcore' database and grant access as
specified.

If you're lucky, you can then do 'cap mysite deploy:setup' and
'cap mysite deploy'!
