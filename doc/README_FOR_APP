LOCAL DEVELOPMENT SET-UP
========================

This needs the following gems:
 * chronic
 * libxml-ruby
 * rake
 * thin
 * packet
 * mysql (optional, but highly recommended)

Other gems are unpacked into vendor/gems/ and don't need to be
installed specially.

Also you need sphinx, from http://www.sphinxsearch.com/

If you plan to deploy, you need capistrano as well.


SERVER SET-UP
=============

On the server, install ruby (including rubygems), nginx, git,
sphinxsearch. Then install the required gems as above.

Then, copy config/deploy-securerb.example to deploy-secure.rb and put
in the database password. Create the 'pbcore' database and grant
access as specified.

If you're lucky, you can then do 'cap deploy:setup' and 'cap deploy'!
